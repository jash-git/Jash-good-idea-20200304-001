# Real-World Machine Learning

This repository includes a set of IPython notebooks with functions and example
code from the Real-World Machine Learning book by Henrik Brink, Joseph
Richards, and Mark Fetherolf published by Manning Books:

https://www.manning.com/books/real-world-machine-learning

The notebooks can be viewed directly in the Github repository:

To run the code yourself, please clone this repo, install IPython (on Python 2.7) and run
`ipython notebook` in the repo directory. We highly recommend installing the Anaconda Python distribution, which includes IPython, Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and mostly anything else used throughout the book:
